<p>I recently sold my Kindle and bought a larger ePaper tablet, a BOOX Note Pro, so that I can read scientific papers and PDFs comfortably.
<img src="images/boox.jpg" alt="Image" />
However, I still use the tablet for leisure and one of the best books I’ve read is the first volume of A Song of Ice and Fire, by George R. R. Martin.<br />
As I wanted to continue reading the saga, I went online and looked for the precious helper that supported my reading of Game of Thrones: a Game of Thrones dictionary.<br />
To my disappointment, I could only find it for the Kindle and the Kobo, but not for my device.</p>
<p>So I decided to do something about it.</p>
<p>The first thing I had to do was to find out what dictionary format my BOOX device accepted.<br />
The <a href="The%20Way%20to%20Add%20Dictionaries%20to%20Your%20Boox%20%7C%20by%20ONYX%20BOOX%20%7C%20BOOX%20Content%20Hub%20%7C%20Medium">BOOX Content Hub</a> mentions the StarDict format and there is even a mention of A Song of Ice and Fire.<br />
It’s as simple as getting the dictionary files and dropping them into a folder called “dicts” on the root directory of the Boox.</p>
<p>Secondly, I had to figure out what I needed to create a StarDict dictionary. Thanks to a <a href="Language%20Hopper:%20How%20to%20make%20your%20own%20Stardict/Goldendict%20compatible%20dictionary">detailed guide</a> I found online, the process is as easy as creating a txt file containing a list of keyword and definitions separated by TABs and using custom-made software to convert it into a StarDict dictionary. As I found out later on, the keywords need to be unique.</p>
<p>Third, I had to determine where to get the information from. As I had previously used the GOT dictionary for Kindle, it was easy finding the GitHub repository containing the files used to build the dictionary. The repo has a folder called "_definitions", containing the dictionary entries in Markdown.</p>
<p>Here is an example for Addam Marbrand:<br />
<img src="images/got.png" alt="Image" /></p>
<p>These files were similarly formatted, with a body of variable length and starting with a YAML header, which defines the title of the definition, a list of synonyms of the title, and the record type (if the entry is a character, a river, etc.).</p>
<p>As I know R and the Tidyverse, the easiest way was for me to read these files and turn them into a list column in a data frame. I then extracted the titles and definitions into new columns with some REGEX.
As I mentioned earlier, some entries have alternative titles specified by the YAML attribute “terms”; with REGEX, I identified the files (rows in my data frame) containing the attribute, duplicated those rows and extracted the alternative name.
This was indispensable as a reader would rarely find the full name of a character; most probably, they would find a shorter version of it, which is listed under “terms”.
I then exported this file as a UTF-8 text file and tried to convert it into a dictionary.</p>
<p>The software threw an error but I quickly realised that the entries have to be unique and there must be some character, whose nickname matches their father’s.<br />
Once I removed this entry, the conversion went through successfully.</p>
<p>The dictionary files can be found here:<br />
<a href="https://federicoconcas.github.io/GOTdict/">GOTdict | A Song of Ice and Fire / Game of Thrones dictionary in StarDict format</a><br />
The associated GitHub repository can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/FedericoConcas/GOTdict">https://github.com/FedericoConcas/GOTdict</a></p>
<p>Creating this dictionary was fairly easy but this is only thanks to the previous work upon which the entries are based. I doubt that someone would have gone to the extent of creating a dictionary for BOOX, without having access to publicly available data such as the Game of Thrones wiki or the GOT Kindle dictionary.<br />
This is obviously one of the cases that demonstrates the power of open-source.</p>
