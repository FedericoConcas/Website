I am a Data Scientist at GSK, helping the rollout of R and Quantitative Decision Making in Big Pharma.  

I am skilled in data analysis, data visualisation, statistical and algorithmic modelling, and I have extensive knowledge of biology.  

I hold an MSc in Data Analytics from the University of Glasgow, where my dissertation focused on the use of GLMs and machine-learning algorithms for the classification of Raman Spectroscopy data.  

As someone who is passionate about Biology, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Biotechnology.
